Regardless of the reason, knowing how to contact MyHeritage can save you time and frustration.

Option 1: Help Center (First Line of Defense)
_______
Before making direct contact, itâ€™s a good idea to check the MyHeritage Help Center. It's a comprehensive knowledge base filled with articles, FAQs, video tutorials, and troubleshooting guides.

Many users find that their questions are already answered here, covering topics from DNA testing to data privacy. It's available 24/7 and is updated regularly with new content.

So, if youâ€™re wondering how to contact MyHeritage, start here. If the Help Center doesnâ€™t solve your problem, move on to one of the direct support options below.

Option 2: Customer Support by Phone ðŸ“ž
_______
MyHeritage does offer phone support in several languages and countries, although availability varies depending on your region and local business hours.

To find the correct contact number for your country, go to the official MyHeritage website and navigate to their support or contact page. Phone support is usually available Monday through Friday during business hours. Wait times can vary, but generally, MyHeritage has a reputation for responsive phone service.

If youâ€™re calling, be sure to have the following ready:

Your account email or user ID

Any relevant order numbers (especially for DNA kits)

A clear description of your issue

ðŸ“ž Pro Tip: Write your question down in advance to stay clear and focused during the call.

Option 3: Email Support
_______
If your issue isnâ€™t urgent, or if you prefer writing over calling, emailing MyHeritage support is another effective option. When emailing, be specific in your subject line and body to help the support team assist you faster.

Include relevant details such as:

Account email address

Screenshots of the issue, if applicable

A detailed timeline of what happened

What youâ€™ve already tried

While response times can vary, most users report hearing back within 1-3 business days.

This is a great option if youâ€™re dealing with technical errors, account issues, or need documentation of your communication.

Live chat is perfect for:

Quick questions

Basic technical support

Help navigating the website

Live chat support may not always be visible or available in all countries. Check the bottom corner of the MyHeritage website homepage â€” if chat is available, a popup or icon will appear to start a conversation.

If you're wondering how to contact MyHeritage through less formal channels, social media can also be a good route. MyHeritage has active accounts on Facebook, Twitter (X), and Instagram, where they post updates, respond to customer inquiries, and share helpful content.

While itâ€™s not ideal for complex account issues, you can send a direct message or comment on a post to get their attention â€” especially for general questions or public feedback.

Social media is particularly useful if youâ€™re having trouble accessing the website or want to know about system-wide issues, like outages.

Option 6: Community Forums and Facebook Groups
_______
If you're more of a DIY problem solver, check out community forums and genealogy Facebook groups. While not run by MyHeritage directly, these communities often include experienced users who can offer quick solutions or point you in the right direction.

Some MyHeritage representatives also monitor these groups and occasionally offer help or clarification.

Search for groups like:

Just remember not to share private information like your account password in these public forums.
